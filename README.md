# Peach-Farming-Assistant
AI-powered Peach Farming Assistant for soil classification, disease detection, and peach counting using deep learning.

Overview
  The Peach Farming Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance peach farming efficiency using machine learning and computer vision. 

It provides:
  1. Soil Classification: Identifies soil types and suggests optimal farming practices.
  2. Disease Detection: Recognizes common peach tree diseases and recommends treatment.
  3. Peach Counting: Uses YOLOv5 to count peaches from video input for yield estimation.
     
Features
  ✅ Soil Analysis – Upload a soil image to classify its type and receive farming suggestions.
  ✅ Disease Diagnosis – Detect peach tree diseases by analyzing leaf/tree images.
  ✅ Peach Yield Estimation – Count peaches in an orchard using video processing.

Technologies Used
  1. Deep Learning Models: InceptionV3 (for soil & disease classification), YOLOv5 (for object detection).
  2. Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit (for UI).
  3. Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.


How It Works
  1. Upload Image/Video: Users provide soil, tree, or video input via the Streamlit interface.
  2. Model Prediction: Deep learning models process the input to classify soil, detect diseases, or count peaches.
  3. Results & Suggestions: Predictions are displayed with actionable recommendations for better peach farming.

Installation & Setup
  1. git clone https://github.com/your-repo/peach-farming-assistant.git  
  2. cd peach-farming-assistant  
  3. pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. streamlit run app.py

Future Enhancements
  1. Integration of real-time drone-based monitoring.
  2. Advanced disease classification with more peach tree disorders.
  3. Yield prediction improvements with additional environmental factors.
